# My English website

It's coded in client side technolgies only, because the hosting neocities as a free hosting allows client side languages only to be served there.

It uses a widget for the commenting system, which depends on google drive to serve comments, and (it may do the same for posts too, but I chosed to serve it in the neocities hosting itself).
